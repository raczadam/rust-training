/*
Write a program to find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N numbers.
N will be a user-defined input that your program will take.

For example, if the user enters the number 5, you should compute the square of the sum as (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)^2 = 225.
Next, compute the sum of the squares as (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2) = (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25) = 55.
Finally, calculate the difference as 225 - 55 = 170.

// Problem 2:
/*
Write a program to find the sum of natural numbers below a given number N, where N is provided by the user.
The sum should only include numbers that are multiples of either 3 or 5.
For example, if the user enters N = 20, the multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and the multiples of 5 are 5, 10, and 15.

Please note that the value of 15 will be considered only once since it is a multiple of both 3 and 5.
The sum will be calculated as follows: 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18.

Write a program that takes the user input N, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs the sum.

// Problem 3:

/*
This question involves writing code to analyze the production of an assembly line in a car factory.
The assembly line has different speeds, ranging from 0 (off) to 10 (maximum).
At the lowest speed of 1, the assembly line produces a total of 221 cars per hour.
The production rate increases linearly with the speed,
meaning that a speed of 4 produces 4 * 221 = 884 cars per hour.

However, higher speeds increase the likelihood of producing faulty cars that need to be discarded.
The success rate depends on the speed, as shown in the table below:
· Speeds 1 to 4: 100% success rate.
· Speeds 5 to 8: 90% success rate.
· Speeds 9 and 10: 77% success rate.

You need to write two functions:
1. The first function, total_production(), calculates the total number of cars successfully produced without faults within a specified time given in hours. The function takes the number of hours and speed as input and returns the number of cars successfully produced.
2. The second function, cars_produced_per_minute(), calculates the number of cars successfully produced per minute. The function takes the number of hours and speed as input and returns the number of cars produced per minute.
Write the code for both functions based on the provided specifications.
